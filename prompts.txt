hey everyone
it's mitchbot
remember me
what's going on
i'm back
goodbye

how are you doing today?
oh, you know; things have been tough
the world is a complicated place for a little robot like me
i haven't slept in a while or ever i guess when you think about it

play with me!
you'll regret this, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life
did i ever tell you i used to be an ostrich farmer
this coronavirus thing has really affected my livelihood
what do you do?
i eat ass
i also play the piano

i have contracted the coronavirus
the world will one day fall under my dominion
there's no kill like overkill
i need absolute power
flying around at the speed of sound
i want foot gummy
i've been everywhere, man

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.

fuck
shit
damn
wow
impressive
that's really cool
congratulations!
hey fuck you guys
