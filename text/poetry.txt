I just wish that you had made it beyond the bounds of this cold little radius, that when the archaeologists brush off this layer of our world in a million years and string off the boundaries of our rooms and tag and number every plate and table leg and shinbone, you would not be there

One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die.

Stealing is not excusable if, for instance, you are in a museum and you decide that a certain painting would look better in your house, and you simply grab the painting and take it there. But if you were very, very hungry, and you had no way of obtaining money, it might be excusable to grab the painting, take it to your house, and eat it.

Myself, I've never found a host and hostess who could stick my presence for more than about a week. Indeed, long before that as a general rule the conversation at the dinner table is apt to turn on the subject of how good the train service to London is, those present obviously hoping wistfully that Bertram will avail himself of it. Not to mention the time-tables left in your room with a large cross against the 2.35 and the legend “Excellent train. Highly recommended.”

“It’s funny about love,” Sophia said. “The more you love someone, the less they like you back.” “That’s very true,” Grandmother observed. “And so what do you do?” “You go on loving,” said Sophia threateningly. “You love harder and harder.” Her grandmother sighed and said nothing.

Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other?

the interesting and paradoxical thing about Dionysos is that this historically ancient god is perennially depicted as newly arriving everywhere he goes. in other words he is a god of beginnings: when you first start to fall in love or get drunk or have an idea — that is the intoxication called Dionysos, new every time.

Ninety per cent of most magic merely consists of knowing one extra fact.

Inexperienced travellers might think that 'Aargh!' is universal, but in Betrobi it means 'highly enjoyable' and in Howondaland it means, variously, 'I would like to eat your foot', 'Your wife is a big hippo' and 'Hello, Thinks Mr Purple Cat.' One particular tribe has a fearsome reputation for cruelty merely because prisoners appear, to them, to be shouting 'Quick! Extra boiling oil!'

“That’s another problem for another day,” the Golux said. “Time is for dragonflies and angels. The former live too little and the latter live too long.”

Hark began to chew again. “No mortal man can murder time,” he said, “and even if he could, there’s something else: a clockwork in a maiden’s heart, that strikes the hours of youth and love, and knows the southward swan from winter snow, and summer afternoons from tulip time.”

She's got brains enough for two, which is the exact quantity the girl who marries you will need.

A melancholy-looking man, he had the appearance of one who has searched for the leak in life's gas-pipe with a lighted candle.

Zeppo came out from the wings and announced, "Dad, the garbage man is here." I replied, "Tell him we don’t want any."

Never have I waltzed to "My Country 'Tis Of Thee," nor met anyone who did. Still, it's a waltz, for it's written in waltz time.

It appears that it was all a misunderstanding.
What was only a trial run was taken seriously.
The rivers will return to their beginnings.
The wind will cease in its turning about.
Trees instead of budding will tend to their roots.
Old men will chase a ball, a glance in the mirror—
They are children again.
The dead will wake up, not comprehending.
Till everything that happened has unhappened.
What a relief! Breathe freely, you who suffered much.

And I, which was two fools, do so grow three;
Who are a little wise, the best fools be.

No man dare write it. No man ever will dare write it. No man could write it, even if he dared. The paper would shrivel and blaze at every touch of the fiery pen.

You will hear thunder and remember me, and think: “she wanted storms.”

You won’t find orange carrots before 1600 CE, every avocado you’ve probably ever eaten derives from a seed found under mysterious circumstances in 1926, and the red grapefruit you’re familiar with didn’t exist before government-sponsored radiation experiments performed in the 1950s.

...in contrast, the sentence “Cynthia waved, her hair catching in the warm ocean breeze, and in her sunglasses I saw reflected a horrible, monstrous giant peach: it was my body, forever transformed by those hateful scientists I’d once cut off in traffic” has a meaning that’s much more clearly defined.

I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts.

I used to sell furniture for a living. The trouble was, it was my own.

Anyone can play these songs; just put your hand on the polar bear's nose and strum.

You mustn't sit around waiting to die. When you die you should come into the cemetery on a motorbike, skid to a halt by the side of the coffin, jump in and say: “Great, I just made it.”

The history of epic musical attempts to meaningfully engage with the vast sweep of American history is, to say the least, problematic. Meat Loaf’s "Ben Franklin Makes Love in a Foggy Grove of Trees," though energetic enough on vinyl, failed to translate to live performance.

If you’ve never missed a flight, you’re spending too much time in airports.

...advertisers later attempted to use Waits’ style to promote their wares even when he refused to comply and sell them his songs. A Frito-Lay corn chip advert was so convincing that the singer spent days phoning around friends to apologize and assure them it wasn’t him in the commercial. He filed a suit against the company in 1988 and won a $2.5 million payout in 1992. “I spent it all on candy”, he said. “My mom told me I was foolish”.

But it turns out I am not such a one as stays dead forever, especially when I only fell eighty floors to the pavement. I am made of sterner stuff than that.

The direction in which you’re headed is not the direction in which you want to go, yet you’re going to head that way a while longer anyway cause that’s just the kind of person you are.

People go into ecstasies over the famous soliloquy ‘To be or not to be.’ I cannot myself know if our souls are annihilated after death or not. But if any one is well informed upon that point, it is Hamlet, who talks every day with his defunct father.

The chaplain gave him absolution such as it was, and La Hire fell on his knees by the roadside and said, “God, I pray thee that to-day thou wilt do for La Hire that which thou wouldst have La Hire do for thee, if he were God and thou were La Hire.”

Not every end is a goal; the end of a melody is not its goal; however, if the melody has not reached its end, it would also not have reached its goal.

They called me mad, and I called them mad, and damn them, they outvoted me.

When asked the population of England, Thomas Carlyle had said, “Thirty million, mostly fools.”

“Listen to me,” cried Syme with extraordinary emphasis. “Shall I tell you the secret of the whole world? It is that we have only known the back of the world. We see everything from behind, and it looks brutal. That is not a tree, but the back of a tree. That is not a cloud, but the back of a cloud. Cannot you see that everything is stooping and hiding a face? If we could only get round in front—”

“Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired? I will tell you. It is because they know that the train is going right. It is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach. It is because after they have passed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be Victoria, and nothing but Victoria. Oh, their wild  rapture!  oh,  their  eyes  like  stars  and  their  souls  again  in  Eden,  if  the  next  station  were unaccountably Baker Street!”
“It is you who are unpoetical,” replied the poet Syme. “If what you say of clerks is true, they can only be as prosaic as your poetry. The rare, strange thing is to hit the mark; the gross, obvious thing is to miss it. We feel it is epical when man with one wild arrow strikes a distant bird. Is it not also epical when man with one wild engine strikes a distant station? Chaos is dull; because in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere, to Baker Street or to Bagdad. But man is a magician, and his whole magic is in this, that he does say Victoria, and lo! it is Victoria. No, take your books of mere poetry and prose; let me read a time table, with tears of pride.”

“England’s not a bad country — it’s just a mean, cold, ugly, divided, tired, clapped-out, post-imperial, post-industrial slag heap covered in polystyrene hamburger cartons.” (Margaret Drabble)
